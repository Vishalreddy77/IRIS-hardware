Sequential logic circuits are electronic circuits that have memory or the ability to store and remember past states. 
These circuits use feedback to remember previous inputs and generate outputs based on both the current inputs and the stored information.
The basic building block of sequential logic circuits is a flip-flop, which is a bistable circuit capable of storing one bit of information. 
Flip-flops can be combined to create more complex circuits such as registers, counters, and memory units.
Let's take the example of a simple sequential logic circuit known as a "D flip-flop" to understand how it works. 
The D flip-flop is a widely used sequential circuit element.
A D flip-flop has two inputs: a data input (D) and a clock input (CLK), and two outputs: the stored value (Q) and its complement (Q'). 
The D input represents the value that we want to store or "flip" into the flip-flop, and the CLK input controls when the flipping operation occurs.
Here's how the D flip-flop operates:
When the CLK input is in the "low" state (0), the flip-flop is in the hold state, meaning it maintains its previous state.
When the CLK input transitions from low to high (rising edge or positive edge), the flip-flop captures the current value of the D input and stores it.
Once the CLK input transitions back to low, the stored value remains unchanged until the next rising edge of the CLK input.
This behavior allows the D flip-flop to remember the last value applied to the D input until a clock pulse occurs, at which point it updates its stored value
