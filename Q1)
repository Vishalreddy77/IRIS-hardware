To design a combinational circuit that produces a 2-bit output based on the conditions d, we can follow these steps:

1. Determine the conditions for prime numbers and divisibility by 6.
   - A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
   - Divisibility by 6 means the number is divisible by both 2 and 3.

2. Create a truth table with inputs X[3:0] and outputs Y[1:0] based on the conditions.
   - In this case, there are 16 possible 4-bit inputs, so the truth table will have 16 rows.

Here is the truth table:

```
| X[3] | X[2] | X[1] | X[0] | Y[1] | Y[0] |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
|  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  0   |  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  0   |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  1   |  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  0   |  1   |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  0   |  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  0   |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  1   |  0   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
|  1   |  1   |  1   |  1   |  0   |  0   |
```

Based on the truth table, we can now design the circuit using basic logic gates.

The circuit diagram for the given conditions is as follows:

```
          +-------+
X[3] ---->|       |
          | Prime |
X[2] ---->| Check |
          |       |
X[1] ---->|       |----> Y[1]
          +-------+
X[0] ---->|       |
