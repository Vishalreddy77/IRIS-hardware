Assuming we have a 2-bit Up/Down counter with inputs U/D (Up/Down) and CLK (Clock), and outputs Q1 and Q0 representing the count value.

At the start, the counter is initialized to the value 00.

1)Initial state: Q1=0, Q0=0

2)Clock Cycle 1:

U/D=0 (Down), CLK transitions from low to high.
Since the Up/Down input is 0 (Down), the counter decrements by 1.
The new state is Q1=1, Q0=1.
3)Clock Cycle 2:

U/D=1 (Up), CLK transitions.
As the Up/Down input is 1 (Up), the counter increments by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=0.
4)Clock Cycle 3:

U/D=1 (Up), CLK transitions.
The counter increments by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=1.
5)Clock Cycle 4:

U/D=0 (Down), CLK transitions.
The counter decrements by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=0.
6)Clock Cycle 5:

U/D=1 (Up), CLK transitions.
The counter increments by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=1.
7)Clock Cycle 6:

U/D=0 (Down), CLK transitions.
The counter decrements by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=0.
8)Clock Cycle 7:

U/D=1 (Up), CLK transitions.
The counter increments by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=1.
9)Clock Cycle 8:

U/D=0 (Down), CLK transitions.
The counter decrements by 1.
The new state is Q1=0, Q0=0.
The pattern of counting repeats based on the input U/D and the clock transitions. 
With each clock cycle, the counter either increments or decrements based on the Up/Down input.
